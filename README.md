# PokerHandEvaluator
Texas Hold 'Em Winning Hand Evaluator
The object of this application is to create functions that can determine the winning hand amongst a number of players.

The hands we will need to deal with, are as follows:
  - High Card
  - Pair
  - Two Pair
  - Three-of-a-Kind
  - Straight
  - Flush
  - Quads
  - Straight Flush
  - Royal Flush
  
The app should be able to decide which hand has won out of a potential total of 10 players. Each player receives two whole cards, and shares five community cards with the rest of the players. The app will decide which player has made the best 5 cards from combining the hole cards and community cards.
